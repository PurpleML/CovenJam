# CovenJam

Hello and welcome to the repository for Team The Coven's entry into the 2021 Texas Game Jam hosted by Egads. 

Generally, try to create a new branch for any feature currently being made and then merge that branch
back into main once the feature is complete. Then re-branch into another new branch to start another
feature. Hopefully this way we can avoid merge conflicts as much as possible.

Generally, we seem to going for a puzzle game of sorts that takes place in an "in between" (possibly magical, purgatorial, or liminal) space.
Mechanics are still being worked out. I have created a 2D unity project simply to be able to start trying some stuff out.
We can absolutely switch to a 3D project if we desire.
